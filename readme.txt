Allow members to mute their friends and shed unwanted items from their BuddyPress activity stream.

== Description ==

Muting a user results in that member's activity items being removed from the site-wide activity stream. Members can be unmuted at any time.

There are many reasons why you might want to mute a person. A friend could be posting too many promotional messages or a former colleague might be regularly talking about work projects. In many of these situations, blocking or unfriending aren't appropriate solutions because you don't want to dissociate yourself from that person.

== Installation ==

1. Download, install and activate the plugin.
1. Enjoy!

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Is the plugin network compatible? =

Yes.

= Which activity streams are muted activity items removed from? =

Muted activity items are removed from the site-wide activity stream if the scope is set to friends or the entire site. To avoid disclosing who is muting who, activity streams elsewhere remain unfiltered.

= Will I continue to get notifications from people after I mute them? =

Yes. If for instance a person you are muting decides to send you a private message, then you will receive a notification.

= How can I mute a person? =

Go to the profile page of the person you wish to mute and look for the Mute button. A mute button is also displayed beside each member in the loop.
