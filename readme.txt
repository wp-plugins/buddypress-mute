Allow members to mute their friends and shed unwanted items from their BuddyPress activity stream.

== Description ==

There are many reasons why you might want to mute a friend. A couple that spring to mind are:

* A friend has been posting too many promotional messages.
* A former colleague always talks about work projects.

In many of these situations, blocking or unfriending aren't appropriate solutions because you don't want to dissociate yourself from that person.
